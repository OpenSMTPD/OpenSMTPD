# args-filter-reject.pl -- filter rejects at mail-from phase
#
# Tests the proc-exec filter mechanism.  filter-stub.pl registers for the
# mail-from phase and responds with a 550 reject.  Verifies that smtpd
# propagates the rejection to the SMTP client and logs the disconnect.
#
# filter_scripts lists the scripts Smtpd.pm stages into a world-accessible
# tmpdir ($filterdir) before starting smtpd, so the _smtpd user can exec them
# regardless of home-directory permissions.
