.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

utility is a
.Xr mailwrapper 8
compatible interface which acts as a local enqueuer for the
.Xr smtpd 8
daemon.
The message is read on standard input (stdin) until
.Nm
encounters an end-of-file.
The
.Nm
enqueuer is not intended to be used directly to send mail,
but rather via a frontend known as a mail user agent.

Unless the optional
.Fl t
flag is specified,
one or more recipients must be specified on the command line.
