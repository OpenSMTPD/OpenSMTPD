.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm filter_api
is an interface intended to provide filter capabilities for the
.Xr smtpd 8
daemon.
.Nm filter_api
is used in standalone filter programs, which setup callback functions to hook
into the SMTP dialog.
For example, each SMTP command can be intercepted with callback functions.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_loop
is used to enter the filter loop, waiting for callback functions to be called.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_accept
can be called to accept the current message with the given
.Fa id
from within a callback function.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn filter_api_reject
and
.Fn filter_api_reject_code
can be called to reject the current message with the given
.Fa id
from within a callback function.
Both expect the
.Fa status
to be specified which should be one of the following values.
.Bl -tag -width -Ds
.It Dv FILTER_FAIL
The filter failed and the message should not be accepted.
.It Dv FILTER_CLOSE
The filter is done and the message should not be accepted.
.El
.Pp
Morover, with the function
.Fn filter_api_reject_code
a
.Fa code
and
.Fa line
can be specified, to reject the current message with a custom SMTP reply code
and error message.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_writeln
is intended to write (received) SMTP DATA command lines (back) from within a
callback function.
This might be used by a filter to add or modifiy DATA lines.
.Sh CALLBACK FUNCTIONS
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_connect
is called on new SMTP connections.
The callback can be used to accept or reject messages based on the given
connection information.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_helo
is called on SMTP HELO command.
The callback can be used to accept or reject messages based on the given HELO
string.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_mail
is called on SMTP MAIL FROM command.
The callback can be used to accept or reject messages based on the given MAIL
FROM address.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_rcpt
is called on SMTP RCPT TO command.
The callback can be used to accept or reject messages based on the given RCPT
TO address.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_data
is called on SMTP DATA command.
The callback might be used to setup data structures for filtering the upcoming
DATA lines.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_dataline
is called on each SMTP DATA line.
The callback can be used to accept or reject messaged based on the (header or
body) content of the current message.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_eom
is called on the end (of DATA command) of the current message.
The callback might be used to cleanup data structures and finalize the decision
of accepting or rejecting the message.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_reset
is called on SMTP RSET command.
The callback might be used to reset the current filter state.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_disconnect
is called on closed SMTP connections.
The callback might be used to cleanup earlier setup data structures.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_commit
is called on commit of the current message.
.\"The callback might be used to trigger further operations.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_on_rollback
is called on rollback of the SMTP session.
The callback might be used to cleanup earlier setup data structures.
.Sh HELPER FUNCTIONS
The function
.Fn filter_api_setugid
can be called using
.Fa uid
and
.Fa gid
to set the running user and group of the filter.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_set_chroot
can be called using
.Fa rootpath
to set the chroot path of the filter.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_no_chroot
can be called to disable chroot for the filter.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_set_udata
can be called for the current message with the given
.Fa id
to set a user data pointer
.Fa data
from within a callback function.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_get_udata
can be called to get the user data pointer for the current message with the
given
.Fa id
from within a callback function.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_sockaddr_to_text
can be called to convert a socket address
.Fa sa
to a string.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_mailaddr_to_text
can be called to convert a mail address
.Fa maddr
to a string.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions
.Fn filter_api_accept ,
.Fn filter_api_reject ,
and
.Fn filter_api_reject_code ,
return 1, intended to be used in a return statement of a callback function.
.Pp
The function
.Fn filter_api_get_udata
returns a pointer to the user data set for the current message.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn filter_api_sockaddr_to_text
and
.Fn filter_api_mailaddr_to_text
return a pointer to a static buffer containing the string representation.
The buffer remains valid until the next call to the conversion functions.
In case of error, the function
.Fn filter_api_sockaddr_to_text
returns the static string
.Dq Li (unknown)
and the function
.Fn filter_api_mailaddr_to_text
returns NULL.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Xr filter-stub 8
which ships with the OpenSMTPD-extras package is intended to provide an example
code template.
.Sh ERRORS
The function
.Fn filter_api_sockaddr_to_text
may fail for any of the errors specified for the routine
.Xr getnameinfo 3
and listed in
.Xr gai_strerror 3 .
